    <h2>What Are Natural Disasters?</h2>
    <div class="card">
        <p>
            A natural disaster is the very harmful impact on a society or community brought by natural phenomenon or hazard.
             Some examples of natural hazards include avalanches, droughts, earthquakes, floods, heat waves, landslides including submarine landslides, 
              for disasters and how strong the buildings, roads, and other structures are.

            A natural disaster is the very harmful impact on a society or community brought by natural phenomenon or hazard. Some examples of natural hazards include avalanches, droughts, earthquakes, floods, heat waves, landslides including submarine landslides, tropical cyclones, volcanic activity and wildfires.Additional natural hazards include blizzards, dust storms, firestorms, hails, ice storms, sinkholes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and tsunamis.
It can cause loss of life or damage property. It typically causes economic damage. How bad the damage is depends on how well people are prepared for disasters and how strong the buildings, roads.
                </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            Climate change has increased the frequency and intensity of many disasters,
            making communities more vulnerable worldwide.

    <h2>Understanding Poverty</h2>
    <div class="card">
        <p>
            Poverty is the lack of sufficient income and resources to meet basic needs such as food,
            shelter, healthcare, and education. Millions of people globally live in vulnerable
            conditions with limited access to safety and protection. Low-income communities often live in areas prone to floods, landslides, or seismic activity due to lower land costs.
            Poor individuals are more likely to work in agriculture or other sectors highly sensitive to extreme weather, losing both their homes and livelihoods simultaneously.
            Lacking savings and insurance, families are forced to use limited assets to cover immediate needs, which prevents them from investing in future resilience and traps them in a cycle of poverty.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Poor communities often lack strong infrastructure, insurance, and emergency systems,
            making them highly exposed to disaster risks.

    <h2>How Natural Disasters and Poverty Are Connected</h2>
    <div class="card">
        <p>
            Natural disasters and poverty create a dangerous cycle:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Poor communities often live in high-risk areas (flood zones, unstable hillsides).</li>
            <li>Weak housing collapses easily during earthquakes or storms.</li>
            <li>After disasters, families lose homes, jobs, and savings.</li>
            <li>Recovery is slower without financial resources.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            As a result, disasters push vulnerable populations deeper into poverty,
            and poverty increases disaster vulnerability.

    <h2>Solutions & Sustainable Actions</h2>

    <div class="card">
        <h3>1. Disaster-Resilient Infrastructure</h3>
        <p>
            Governments and communities must invest in stronger buildings, flood defenses,
            early warning systems, and climate-resilient infrastructure.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h3>2. Education & Awareness</h3>
        <p>
            Teaching communities about disaster preparedness saves lives.
            Emergency training and evacuation planning reduce risks significantly.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h3>3. Poverty Reduction Programs</h3>
        <p>
            Providing access to education, healthcare, and stable employment strengthens
            resilience and allows families to recover faster after disasters.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h3>4. Climate Action</h3>
        <p>
            Reducing carbon emissions, protecting forests, and promoting renewable energy
            help minimize extreme weather events in the long term.
